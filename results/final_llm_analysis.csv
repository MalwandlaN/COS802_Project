It correctly renders 'mice' as plural ('beraye') and accurately conveys '4-month-old' ('masu wata huɗu') and 'used to be diabetic' ('kuma a dā suna da ciwon sukari'). The placement of the reported speech ('Ya kara da cewa:') is also idiomatic in Hausa. The provided 'Correct Reference' has issues with number agreement ('bera' for 'mice') and less accurate phrasing for 'used to be diabetic' ('suke fama' implying current suffering), making the MT Hypothesis a more faithful translation."

The correct translation should convey 'no relation' or 'no relevance' (e.g., 'ba shi da alaƙa'). Additionally, the MT omits the word 'already' from 'people who already have Type 1 diabetes,' which impacts the completeness and nuance of the sentence. The phrasing for 'noting that' ('yana lura cewa') is also less idiomatic than the reference's 'inda ya bayyana cewa' for this context."

The correct feminine form 'sakatariyar dindindin' should have been used for proper gender agreement."

Additionally, the translation for 'wasn't audible' ('ba a ji') is less precise than the reference's 'ba a jiyo sauti' which better conveys audibility."
6,NLLB,hau,"He built a WiFi door bell, he said.","Ya ce ya gina ƙofar ƙofar WiFi, ya ce.","Ya ce, ya gina ƙararrawar ƙofa ta WiFi.",True,Meaning/Semantics,"The MT translated ""door bell"" as ""ƙofar ƙofar"" (door door), which is an incorrect translation that fundamentally alters the meaning of the object built. The correct term for ""doorbell"" in Hausa is ""ƙararrawar ƙofa"". Additionally, the phrase ""ya ce"" is repeated unnecessarily, affecting the fluency and naturalness of the sentence."

The correct term for an episode of a TV show would be ""shirin"" or ""kashi"" as used in the reference (""shirin wasan kwaikwayon""), making the MT's choice inappropriate for the context."
8,NLLB,hau,"In late 2017, Siminoff appeared on shopping television channel QVC.","A ƙarshen 2017, Siminoff ya bayyana a tashar talabijin ta QVC.","A ƙarshen 2017, Siminoff ya bayyana a tashar telebijin mai sayarwa ta QVC.",True,Meaning/Semantics,"The MT hypothesis omits the translation for 'shopping' (mai sayarwa) when describing the television channel. The source specifies it as a 'shopping television channel,' but the MT translates it simply as 'television channel,' which loses a key semantic detail about the channel's purpose."
9,NLLB,hau,"Ring also settled a lawsuit with competing security company, the ADT Corporation.","Ring kuma ya warware karar da kamfanin tsaro mai fafatawa, ADT Corporation.",Ring ta kuma sasanta takardar kotu tsakanin wata kamfanin adawa na tsaro wato ADT Corporation.,True,Grammar/Syntax,"The MT uses the masculine pronoun 'ya' instead of the correct feminine 'ta' for 'Ring' (a company/entity), which is a grammatical agreement error. Additionally, the verb 'warware' (resolved) is less precise for 'settled a lawsuit' than 'sasanta' (reconciled/settled a dispute) as used in the reference. The phrasing 'karar da kamfanin tsaro' is also less idiomatic and precise than 'takardar kotu tsakanin wata kamfanin adawa na tsaro' for this context."

This is a critical lexical error that fundamentally changes the meaning of the sentence. As a result, the subsequent pronoun agreement ('tšeo' instead of 'ao') is also incorrect."

Additionally, the MT uses more verbose phrases like 'tša thutamahlale' for 'scientific' and 'matšatšing a yona a mathomo' for 'in its early days', which are less concise and idiomatic than 'mahlale' and 'matšatšing a pele' in the reference, indicating fluency and word choice issues. However, the MT correctly maintains the singular subject pronoun 'o' for 'cautioned', matching the source, unlike the plural 'ba' in the provided reference."

All key phrases are correctly rendered. Differences from the reference, such as 'Go swana le' vs 'Bjalo ka' (both meaning 'like'), 'belaela' vs 'gonona' (both meaning 'skeptical/doubt'), 'dilo tše di hweditšwego' (things found) vs 'dikarabo tše' (answers/results) for 'findings', and translating 'diabetes' vs retaining the English term, are stylistic choices and do not constitute errors. The MT's choices are natural and correct in Sepedi."

Firstly, it translates 'Nobel Committee for Literature' as 'Komiti ya Nobel ya Mangwalo' and '2016 Nobel Prize in Literature' as 'Moputso wa Nobel wa 2016 wa Mangwalo', while the reference uses 'Komiti ye Kgethwa ya Dipuku' and 'Sefoka sa 2016 ka Dipuku' respectively. This alters the specific identity of the committee and the prize. Secondly and more critically, the MT attributes the inability to reach Bob Dylan and the abandonment of efforts to the 'committee' ('komiti ye... e sa kgone... e tlogetše'), whereas the reference attributes these actions to Sara Danius ('a palelwa ke... o tlogetše'). This constitutes a fundamental change in the subject performing the actions, leading to a significant meaning alteration relative to the reference."

Additionally, the MT uses ""o itše"" for ""said,"" which is less complete than the more idiomatic ""o boletše gore"" for reported speech in the reference. It also uses the more verbose ""melaetša ya elektroniki"" for ""emails"" instead of the more concise ""diimeile"" from the reference."

Firstly, 'lenaka la mojako' (door horn) was used instead of the correct term 'tšhipi ya mojako' (doorbell). Secondly, 'le be le sa kwewe' (it was not heard - passive) was used instead of 'e be e sa kwagale' (it was not audible), failing to accurately convey 'wasn't audible'. Thirdly, the preposition 'from' ('go tšwa') was omitted before 'his shop', making it read 'in his shop' instead of 'from his shop'."

The reference's translation 'go tsenya mašeleng gore e thome kgwebo' (to invest money so it starts a business) is much more accurate. Additionally, 'seripa' is a less precise word choice for 'episode' than 'karolo', and 'sehlopha' is less accurate than 'phanele' for 'panel'."

It omits the explicit translation of ""channel"", which is present in the source and correctly translated as ""tšhaneleng"" in the reference. While the meaning is generally understood, the omission makes the translation less precise and complete lexically."

In Nso, for this context, 'gape' should generally follow the verb it modifies, 'rarolla' (settled), as demonstrated in the correct reference.

The correct reference uses 'u lemukise' (cautioned/warned), which is semantically more accurate. Additionally, the phrase 'in its early days' was translated very literally as 'emasikwini ya wona yo sungula' instead of the more idiomatic 'emasungulweni' used in the reference, impacting fluency."

Furthermore, 'about winning' is translated as 'malunghana ni ku kuma' (concerning receiving/getting) instead of 'malunghana ni ku hlula kakwe' (concerning his winning), which alters the intended meaning. The MT also loses some nuance in translating 'had abandoned its efforts' by using 'yi tshike matshalatshala ya yona' (it abandoned its efforts) which is less precise than 'yi tshikile matshalatshala lawa a yi ma endla' (it had abandoned the efforts it was making) from the reference, thus affecting the temporal aspect and completeness."

The phrase ""ri nga twiwi exitolo xakwe egaraji"" translates to ""was not heard at/in his shop in his garage,"" which deviates from the source's meaning of the doorbell not being audible *from the perspective of being inside the shop*. The reference correctly conveys this perspective by focusing on the CEO's location: ""loko a ri exitolo lexi a xi ri agarajini yakwe"" (when he was in the shop that was in his garage). Additionally, the MT uses less precise terms for ""Previously"" (Eku sunguleni vs. Enkarhini lowu hundzeke) and ""doorbell"" (riqingho ra yena vs. bele rakwe ra le nyangweni), and ""wasn't audible"" (ri nga twiwi vs. a ri nga twali kahle)."

The source places the reporting clause at the end of the statement, which is better reflected by the reference's 'U ri, u endle...'. Additionally, the translation of 'door bell' as 'bele ya nyangwa' (bell of door) is less idiomatic and grammatically less precise than 'bele ra le nyangweni' (bell at the door), which uses a locative construction.

Although ""xitichi"" is a direct translation of ""channel"", the reference suggests that ""nongonoko"" is the more appropriate and nuanced meaning for someone appearing on a shopping television channel, implying appearance on a specific broadcast segment. This results in a semantic difference regarding what Siminoff appeared on. Additionally, the MT uses ""humelele"" for ""appeared,"" while ""humelerile"" (used in the Correct Reference) is generally considered a more precise and preferred form for the perfect tense of 'to appear' in Xitsonga, avoiding potential ambiguity with 'succeeded'."
9,NLLB,tso,"Ring also settled a lawsuit with competing security company, the ADT Corporation.","Ring u tlhele a lulamisa nandzu lowu a wu ri ni khampani yin'wana ya vuhlayiseki leyi a yi phikizana na yena, ku nga ADT Corporation.","Ring yi tlhele yi lulamisa nandzu lowu a wu khumba khampani ya vusirheleri leyi a yi phikizana na yona, ku nga ADT Corporation.",True,Grammar/Syntax,"The MT contains significant grammatical errors. The subject concord for 'Ring' (a company) is incorrect, using 'u' (class 1, for people) instead of 'yi' (class 9). Similarly, the object pronoun 'yena' (class 1) is used instead of 'yona' (class 9) when referring back to 'Ring'. Additionally, the MT incorrectly adds 'yin'wana' (another), which subtly alters the original meaning of the source text, and uses 'vuhlayiseki' instead of the more appropriate 'vusirheleri' for 'security' in this context."

'Inyanga' (month) is singular, but 'ezine' (four) requires the plural form 'izinyanga'. It should be 'anezinyanga ezine' or 'anezinyanga ezingu-4'. Additionally, 'ubudala' (age) is redundant and less idiomatic when specifying the age of animals in months. The placement of 'Wanezela:' at the beginning of the quote also deviates from the source's 'he added' at the end, impacting the natural flow in Zulu."

Additionally, the phrase ""is still in its early days"" is translated very literally in the MT as ""lusesezinsukwini zalo zokuqala"". While understandable, this is less fluent and natural compared to the idiomatic ""lusanda kuqala"" (has just started/is still new) provided in the reference, which better captures the nuance of something being in its initial stages."

The correct reference uses ""akubathinti"" (do not affect them/are not relevant to them). Additionally, the phrase ""kungenzeka yini ukuphulukiswa kwesifo sikashukela"" for ""whether diabetes can be cured"" is less natural and more convoluted than the reference's direct translation ""ukuthi isifo sikashukela singalashwa""."

Although the MT's tense aligns with the source, the evaluation is against the provided 'Correct Reference.' Additionally, the MT's phrasing for ""permanent secretary"" (""ongunobhala ohlala njalo"") is less idiomatic than the reference's ""unobhala wesikhathi sonke."" The construction ""yokufinyelela kuye"" for ""to reach him"" is also less idiomatic and concise than the reference's ""yokumfinyelela."""

It translates ""Right now"" as ""Manje"" (now) instead of the more precise ""Okwamanje"" (right now/for now). More significantly, it translates ""his closest collaborator"" as ""kumuntu owayesebenza naye"" (to the person who was working with him), which is singular and implies a past action, rather than accurately conveying the sense of 'closest collaborator' as plural and continuous collaboration (as in the reference's 'kwabasondelene naye kakhulu asebenzisana nabo'). Additionally, the MT omits the word ""certainly"" from ""that is certainly enough,"" losing a crucial part of the original meaning."

It translates 'doorbell' literally as 'insimbi yakhe' (his bell), which is less natural and less specific than the descriptive phrase used in the reference ('kukhona ongqongqozayo emnyango' - 'someone knocking at the door'). More critically, the MT's 'ingezwakali esitolo sakhe egaraji' implies the bell wasn't audible *at* his shop in the garage. In contrast, the source implies he couldn't hear it *while he was in* his shop, which was located in his garage. The reference accurately captures this by using 'uma esesitolo sakhe esisegalaji lakhe' (if he was in his shop, which is in his garage)."

The correct translation for 'door bell' is 'insimbi yasemnyango', as provided in the reference. This constitutes a significant word choice error that changes the meaning of the object built."

It correctly uses the class 1 prefix 'u-' for the proper noun 'Siminoff' and maintains subject-verb agreement ('wavela'). The phrase 'shopping television channel' is appropriately translated as 'esiteshini sethelevishini sokuthenga'. The provided reference contains a grammatical error by using 'iSiminoff' instead of 'uSiminoff' for a person's name, which consequently affects the verb agreement ('savela')."

Firstly, for 'Ring', it uses the prefix 'I-Ring' (class 9) instead of the grammatically correct 'U-Ring' (class 1, often used for proper nouns/company names acting as subjects), as seen in the reference. Secondly, and more significantly, it translates 'lawsuit' as 'isimangalo' (claim/petition) instead of 'icala' (case/lawsuit), which is the more accurate term as used in the reference. This constitutes a word choice error that impacts the precision of the legal term. Additionally, 'eyayincintisana nayo' (which was competing with it) is past tense, while 'ancintisana nayo' (which competes with it) from the reference, or 'ecintisana nayo' (competing with it) would better reflect the meaning of 'competing' in the source."
